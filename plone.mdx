## Abstract

The goal of this project is to refactor all class-based components in Volto, the React-based frontend for the Plone content management system, to functional components using React hooks. This will improve code maintainability, readability, and performance, aligning Volto with modern React best practices.

## Introduction

Volto is a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly frontend for the Plone content management system. It is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React has evolved over time, introducing new features and best practices. One such change is the shift from class-based components to functional components, which offer a simpler and more efficient way to manage component state and lifecycle.

Currently, some components in Volto are still class-based, which can lead to inconsistencies in the codebase and make it harder for new contributors to get started. This project aims to refactor these class-based components into functional components, using React hooks to manage state and lifecycle methods.

## Objectives

1. Identify all class-based components in the Volto codebase.
2. Prioritize components based on their complexity and impact on the overall codebase.
3. Convert class-based components to functional components using React hooks.
4. Ensure that all tests pass and the application functions as expected after refactoring.
5. Update documentation to reflect the changes.

## Methodology

1. **Analysis:** Perform a thorough analysis of the Volto codebase to identify all class-based components.
2. **Planning:** Create a detailed plan for refactoring, including a list of components to be converted, an estimated timeline, and potential challenges.
3. **Conversion:** Refactor components one by one, starting with the simplest and moving towards more complex components. Use React hooks, such as useState and useEffect, to replace state and lifecycle methods.
4. **Testing:** After refactoring each component, run tests to ensure that the application functions as expected. Fix any issues that arise during testing.
5. **Documentation:** Update the documentation to reflect the changes made during refactoring.

## Timeline

**Week 1-2:** Analysis and planning

- Identify class-based components
- Prioritize components for refactoring
- Create a detailed plan and timeline

**Week 3-8:** Conversion and testing

- Refactor components one by one
- Test each component after refactoring
- Fix any issues that arise during testing

**Week 9-10:** Documentation and finalization

- Update documentation to reflect changes
- Perform final testing and bug fixes
- Submit the final project report

## Expected Outcomes

- A more consistent and maintainable Volto codebase
- Improved performance and readability
- Easier onboarding for new contributors
- Updated documentation

## Conclusion

This project will improve the overall quality of the Volto codebase by converting class-based components to functional components using React hooks. This will align the project with modern React best practices, making it easier for new contributors to get started and ensuring a more maintainable and efficient codebase for the future.
