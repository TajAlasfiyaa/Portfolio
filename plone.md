## Abstract

The goal of this project is to refactor all class-based components in Volto, the React-based frontend for the Plone content management system, to functional components using React hooks. This will improve code maintainability, readability, and performance, aligning Volto with modern React best practices.

## Introduction

Volto is a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly frontend for the Plone content management system. It is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React has evolved over time, introducing new features and best practices. One such change is the shift from class-based components to functional components, which offer a simpler and more efficient way to manage component state and lifecycle.

Currently, some components in Volto are still class-based, which can lead to inconsistencies in the codebase and make it harder for new contributors to get started. This project aims to refactor these class-based components into functional components, using React hooks to manage state and lifecycle methods.

## Objectives

1. Identify all class-based components in the Volto codebase.
2. Prioritize components based on their complexity and impact on the overall codebase.
3. Convert class-based components to functional components using React hooks.
4. Ensure that all tests pass and the application functions as expected after refactoring.
5. Update documentation to reflect the changes.

## Methodology

1. **Analysis:** Perform a thorough analysis of the Volto codebase to identify all class-based components.
2. **Planning:** Create a detailed plan for refactoring, including a list of components to be converted, an estimated timeline, and potential challenges.
3. **Conversion:** Refactor components one by one, starting with the simplest and moving towards more complex components. Use React hooks, such as useState and useEffect, to replace state and lifecycle methods.
4. **Testing:** After refactoring each component, run tests to ensure that the application functions as expected. Fix any issues that arise during testing.
5. **Documentation:** Update the documentation to reflect the changes made during refactoring.

# Detailed Timeline

## Week 1
- Analyze the Volto codebase.
- Identify class-based components that can be refactored.
- Create a list of components and categorize them based on complexity (low, medium, high).

## Week 2
- Prioritize components based on complexity and dependencies.
- Develop a detailed plan for refactoring each component.
- Discuss the plan with the Plone team and incorporate their feedback.

## Weeks 3-4
- Refactor low complexity components.
- Write unit tests for each refactored component.
- Perform integration tests to ensure compatibility with the rest of the codebase.
- Document the changes made for each component.

## Weeks 5-6
- Refactor medium complexity components.
- Write unit tests for each refactored component.
- Perform integration tests to ensure compatibility with the rest of the codebase.
- Document the changes made for each component.

## Weeks 7-8
- Refactor high complexity components.
- Write unit tests for each refactored component.
- Perform integration tests to ensure compatibility with the rest of the codebase.
- Document the changes made for each component.

## Week 9
- Review the entire codebase and ensure all identified components have been refactored.
- Update documentation and code comments to reflect the changes made during the refactoring process.
- Address any issues found during testing.

## Week 10
- Conduct a thorough review of the refactored codebase.
- Optimize the code, if necessary, for better performance and readability.
- Prepare a final report detailing the changes made and the benefits of the refactoring process.

## Weeks 11-12
- Collaborate with the Plone team for code review and final adjustments.
- Address any feedback provided by the Plone team.
- Merge the changes into the main codebase.
- Submit the final report and project documentation.


## Expected Outcomes

- A more consistent and maintainable Volto codebase
- Improved performance and readability
- Easier onboarding for new contributors
- Updated documentation

## Why I believe I would be a great fit for this project:

1. Proficiency in React: I have a deep love for React and have been following its developments closely. I recently watched the last React conference, which has further enhanced my understanding of the latest best practices and advancements in the library.

2. Quick Learner and Fast Typer: As a fast typer, I can efficiently navigate through codebases and make necessary changes with minimal errors. My ability to quickly grasp new concepts will enable me to your codebase and make meaningful contributions in a short period.

3. Commitment to Quality: I understand the importance of clean, maintainable code and will ensure that my work adheres to the highest standards. I am dedicated to improving the performance and readability of Volto by converting class-based components to functional components wherever possible.

4. Team Player: I believe that collaboration and effective communication are key to the success of any project. I am excited to work with the talented Plone team and contribute to the ongoing development of this fantastic project.

## Conclusion

This project will improve the overall quality of the Volto codebase by converting class-based components to functional components using React hooks. This will align the project with modern React best practices, making it easier for new contributors to get started and ensuring a more maintainable and efficient codebase for the future.
